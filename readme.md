## Ex 1
### Hybrid Sort: Merge Sort and Inserion Sort combined togheter

- In this experiment, both InsertionSort and MergeSort are implemented.
- We measure the experimental execution time for inputs of increasing length, with multiple repetitions for the same length, on both algorithms. 
- We infers the value of k (maximum crossing point between the curves) for our own machine and implementation.

## Ex 2
### Hash Table VS Red Black Tree

- We conduct an experiment implementing both a hash table with conflicts resolved via chaining and a red-black tree. 
- We measure and compare the average time for n operations with n increasing, random greater than zero integer keys, on both structures. 
- We perform some comparisons for different values of m (fixed size of the hash table) and different proportions between number of insertions and number of searches.


## Ex 2
### Dijkstra: Array VS Binary Heap

- We perform an experiment implementing the Dijkstra algorithm using either an array or a binary heap as the priority queue. 
- We measure the average execution time as the size of the graph increases for a fixed source and as the density varies in both versions.
- We compare the execution times.
